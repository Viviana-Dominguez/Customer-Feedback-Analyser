# Customer-Feedback-Analyser
## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer feedback from a hospitality business to derive actionable insights. By calculating the Net Promoter Score (NPS), performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews, and utilizing topic modeling to identify recurring themes, this analysis aims to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. The insights generated can help businesses enhance service quality and refine their marketing strategies. Detailed markdowns guide you through the analysis steps and provide a clear rationale behind each method used, making it easy for others to replicate the analysis with their own datasets.

## Key Features/Techniques
- Net Promoter Score (NPS): Categorized customers into Promoters, Passives, and Detractors to assess loyalty and satisfaction.
- Sentiment Analysis: Analyzed customer reviews to determine the emotional tone (positive, neutral, negative) using AI models.
- Topic Modeling: Used embeddings to identify and extract key themes from customer feedback.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Cleaned and visualized data to uncover patterns and potential issues.

## Dataset
- Source: guest_data_with_reviews.xlsx
- Details: The dataset contains customer demographic information, feedback ratings, and textual reviews, providing insights into customer satisfaction and loyalty. Key columns include "How likely are you to recommend us?" for NPS calculation and "Review" for sentiment and topic analysis.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, plotly, NLTK/Spacy, sklearn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results and Impact
This analysis provides businesses with a deeper understanding of customer sentiment and feedback trends, allowing for targeted improvements in service offerings. By calculating NPS and performing sentiment and topic analyses, businesses can refine their strategies to retain customers and boost satisfaction.
